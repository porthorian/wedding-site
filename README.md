# Wedding Website (Nuxt 4 + Vue 3 + Vuetify)

Whimsical wedding website built with Nuxt, Vue 3, and Vuetify. The design leans into soft botanicals,
floating florals, and gentle motion to create a storybook feel.

## Goals

- Use Vuetify for layout, typography, and sections.
- Add animated floral accents and a warm, whimsical palette.
- Keep the page responsive with a clear RSVP-focused call to action.

   - Define theme colors in Vuetify.
   - Add custom fonts and background gradients.
   - Introduce animated floral elements for ambiance.

   - Schedule, travel, registry, gallery, RSVP band.
3. **Polish**
   - Staggered reveal animations.
   - Verify mobile layout and spacing.
